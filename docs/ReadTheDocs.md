To publish your Sphinx documentation to **Read the Docs**, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Create an Account on Read the Docs**
- Go to [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and create an account.
- Log in and connect your account to your GitHub repository.

---

### 2. **Configure Your Repository**
Ensure your repository contains the necessary files and structure for Read the Docs:
- **`docs/` directory**: Contains your Sphinx documentation, including `conf.py` and `.rst` files.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies for building your documentation.

#### Example `requirements.txt`:
```plaintext
sphinx
breathe
sphinx-autodoc-typehints
sphinx-rtd-theme
myst-parser[linkify]
```

If you have additional dependencies, include them here.

---

### 3. **Set Up a `readthedocs.yml` File (Optional but Recommended)**
Place a `readthedocs.yml` file in the root of your repository to configure your Read the Docs build environment.

#### Example `readthedocs.yml`:
```yaml
# .readthedocs.yml

version: 2

build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.11"

python:
  install:
    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt

sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py
```

This file specifies:
- The Python version to use.
- The location of your `requirements.txt`.
- The path to your Sphinx configuration file.

---

### 4. **Import the Project on Read the Docs**
1. Go to your **Read the Docs** dashboard.
2. Click **Import a Project**.
3. Select the repository containing your documentation.
4. Follow the prompts to configure the project:
   - Set the **Python interpreter** to match the version in `readthedocs.yml`.
   - Set the **Documentation directory** to `docs/` or the appropriate path.

---

### 5. **Trigger a Build**
After importing the project, Read the Docs will automatically build your documentation. If the build fails, check the logs in the **Builds** section.

---

### 6. **View Your Documentation**
Once the build succeeds, your documentation will be live at a URL like:
```
https://<project-name>.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
```

---

### 7. **Update Links**
Replace your GitHub Pages link in the repository (README or description) with the new **Read the Docs** link.

---

### Troubleshooting
- If the build fails, check the **Build Logs** on Read the Docs for errors.
- Ensure your `conf.py` and `readthedocs.yml` are correctly configured.
- Use a virtual environment locally to verify that `requirements.txt` installs all dependencies.
