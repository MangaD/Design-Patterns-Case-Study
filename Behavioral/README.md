# Behavioral Design Patterns

## **Overview**

Behavioral Design Patterns focus on **how objects interact** and communicate with each other. These patterns provide solutions for assigning responsibilities among objects, reducing tight coupling, and optimizing communication between them. By employing behavioral patterns, developers can ensure flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in their applications.

Behavioral patterns are particularly useful when designing systems where:
- The behavior is distributed among multiple objects.
- The control flow or logic depends on dynamic runtime decisions.
- Reusability and modularity are critical for success.

## **Patterns Overview**

| **Pattern**               | **Intent**                                                                 | **Key Features**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along a chain of handlers.                                | Decouples sender and receiver, allowing multiple handlers to process requests.                       |
| **Command**                | Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing. | Decouples request execution from request initiation, supporting undo/redo operations.                |
| **Iterator**               | Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.            | Supports different traversal methods without exposing the collection’s implementation.               |
| **Mediator**               | Centralizes communication between objects.                                | Reduces dependencies by allowing objects to communicate indirectly through a mediator.               |
| **Memento**                | Captures and restores an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation. | Enables undo functionality by saving and restoring previous states.                                  |
| **Observer**               | Establishes a dependency between objects for event notification.           | Allows multiple observers to react to state changes in a subject.                                    |
| **State**                  | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its state changes.              | Encapsulates state-specific behavior, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.                         |
| **Strategy**               | Defines a family of algorithms and allows dynamic selection.                | Promotes flexibility by encapsulating algorithms independently of the context in which they are used. |
| **Template Method**        | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring steps to subclasses.        | Promotes code reuse by standardizing the structure while allowing customization of specific steps.    |
| **Visitor**                | Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. | Allows adding new operations to objects without modifying their classes.                             |

## **Why Use Behavioral Patterns?**

### **1. Decoupled Communication**
- Minimize dependencies between objects by abstracting interactions.
- Support flexible communication that adapts to runtime needs.

### **2. Reusability and Extensibility**
- Encapsulate behaviors in reusable components.
- Add new behaviors or operations without altering existing code, adhering to the **Open-Closed Principle**.

### **3. Dynamic Control Flow**
- Allow runtime changes in behavior, enabling systems to adapt to evolving requirements.

### **4. Improved Maintainability**
- Organize responsibilities and logic clearly, making code easier to maintain, debug, and test.

## **Detailed Pattern Descriptions**

### **1. Chain of Responsibility**

**Intent**:
- Pass a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.

**Common Applications**:
- Logging systems with different levels of severity.
- Request validation pipelines in web servers or APIs.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Decouples sender and receiver.
- Handlers can be easily added or removed.

**Trade-offs**:
- Can lead to unintentional request skipping if no handler processes it.
- Increases complexity if chains become too long.

---

### **2. Command**

**Intent**:
- Encapsulate a request as an object to parameterize, queue, or log it.

**Common Applications**:
- GUI buttons triggering specific actions.
- Undo/redo functionality in text editors.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Decouples the invoker (e.g., button) from the receiver (e.g., operation).
- Supports request history for undo/redo.

**Trade-offs**:
- Increases the number of classes due to command objects.
- Requires additional logic for complex undo operations.

---

### **3. Iterator**

**Intent**:
- Provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying implementation.

**Common Applications**:
- Iterating through collections such as arrays, lists, or trees.
- Abstracting traversal logic in complex data structures.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Supports multiple traversal algorithms.
- Simplifies client code by abstracting iteration logic.

**Trade-offs**:
- Can complicate synchronization in concurrent environments.
- May introduce overhead for simple collections.

---

### **4. Mediator**

**Intent**:
- Centralize and simplify communication between objects.

**Common Applications**:
- Chat systems with a central server mediating messages.
- UI components interacting via a controller.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Reduces direct dependencies between objects.
- Promotes the Single Responsibility Principle by centralizing logic.

**Trade-offs**:
- Can become a bottleneck if too much responsibility is placed on the mediator.
- May increase complexity in large systems.

---

### **5. Memento**

**Intent**:
- Capture an object’s internal state to restore it later.

**Common Applications**:
- Undo/redo functionality in text editors.
- Snapshotting system configurations.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Preserves encapsulation by hiding the details of the saved state.
- Supports multiple snapshots.

**Trade-offs**:
- Can consume significant memory for large or frequent states.
- Requires careful management of memento lifecycles.

---

### **6. Observer**

**Intent**:
- Notify multiple observers when a subject changes its state.

**Common Applications**:
- Event-driven systems such as GUIs or notification services.
- Real-time updates in stock or weather tracking apps.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Promotes loose coupling between subjects and observers.
- Supports dynamic addition or removal of observers.

**Trade-offs**:
- May result in performance overhead for frequent updates.
- Can lead to unexpected behavior if observers are not managed properly.

---

### **7. State**

**Intent**:
- Allow an object to change its behavior based on its state.

**Common Applications**:
- State machines in game development or workflow systems.
- Objects with varying modes, such as a document editor switching between edit and view modes.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes.
- Simplifies complex conditional logic in objects.

**Trade-offs**:
- Increases the number of classes.
- Requires careful state transitions to avoid inconsistencies.

---

### **8. Strategy**

**Common Applications**:
- Workflow systems with predefined steps but variable implementations.
- Game loops or initialization processes.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Promotes code reuse by standardizing algorithms.
- Ensures consistent execution flow.

**Trade-offs**:
- Reduces flexibility by imposing a predefined algorithm structure.
- Can lead to code duplication if not carefully designed.

---

### **10. Visitor**

**Intent**:
- Perform operations on elements of an object structure without modifying their classes.

**Common Applications**:
- Traversing and processing nodes in hierarchical structures.
- Compilers analyzing syntax trees.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Supports adding new operations without modifying objects.
- Separates algorithms from data structures.

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires exposing the object structure to visitors.
- May become cumbersome with frequent structural changes.
