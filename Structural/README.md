# Structural Design Patterns

## **Overview**

Structural Design Patterns focus on **class and object composition**, helping developers form larger, more complex structures while maintaining flexibility and scalability. These patterns define clear relationships between components, often simplifying their interactions and ensuring that they work seamlessly together.

By employing structural patterns, developers can build systems that are easier to maintain, extend, and optimize, adhering to principles like **low coupling** and **high cohesion**.

## **Patterns Overview**

| **Pattern**           | **Intent**                                                                  | **Key Features**                                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adapter**           | Converts one interface into another to allow incompatible systems to work together. | Enables integration without modifying existing code.                                             |
| **Bridge**            | Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing both to vary independently. | Facilitates scalability and flexibility in multi-dimensional hierarchies.                        |
| **Composite**         | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. | Simplifies client interaction with complex structures.                                           |
| **Decorator**         | Dynamically adds behavior to objects without altering their structure.     | Promotes reusability and adherence to the Open-Closed Principle.                                 |
| **Facade**            | Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code or subsystem.     | Reduces complexity by hiding intricate subsystem details.                                        |
| **Flyweight**         | Reduces memory usage by sharing common data between similar objects.       | Optimizes performance for applications with numerous similar objects.                            |
| **Proxy**             | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.                   | Controls access, adds security, or improves efficiency by managing object interactions.          |

## **Why Use Structural Patterns?**

### **1. Simplified Code Interactions**
- Abstracts complex relationships, making systems easier to understand and extend.
- Hides intricate details of subsystems or object hierarchies.

### **2. Increased Flexibility**
- Supports changes in the systemâ€™s structure without requiring significant modifications to the core components.

### **3. Enhanced Scalability**
- Facilitates seamless addition of new components or variations.

### **4. Optimized Resource Management**
- Reduces system overhead by leveraging patterns like Flyweight and Proxy to share resources or defer expensive operations.

---

## **Detailed Pattern Descriptions**

### **1. Adapter**

**Intent**:
- Convert an existing interface into one that the client expects.

**Common Applications**:
- Integrating legacy systems with new frameworks.
- Allowing incompatible APIs to work together.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Can be implemented as a class adapter (using inheritance) or an object adapter (using composition).
- Enables systems to work together without changing their core code.

**Trade-offs**:
- Adds additional layers, which can increase system complexity.
- Overuse might lead to unnecessary abstraction.

---

### **2. Bridge**

**Intent**:
- Decouple abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.

**Common Applications**:
- Separating platform-specific code from core application logic.
- Multi-dimensional hierarchies, such as separating device types and rendering methods.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Promotes scalability and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Uses composition to delegate implementation-specific behavior.

**Trade-offs**:
- Initial design complexity due to abstraction layers.
- Overuse may introduce unnecessary overhead.

---

### **3. Composite**

**Intent**:
- Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies.

**Common Applications**:
- UI frameworks to model hierarchies of components (e.g., buttons, panels).
- File systems with directories and files.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Simplifies client code by treating individual objects and groups uniformly.
- Facilitates recursive operations over hierarchical structures.

**Trade-offs**:
- May make it harder to restrict certain operations to specific components.
- Requires careful management of tree structures for efficiency.

---

### **4. Decorator**

**Intent**:
- Add new functionality to objects dynamically without modifying their structure.

**Common Applications**:
- Adding UI features like scrollbars or borders to graphical elements.
- Extending behavior of classes in middleware or frameworks.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Promotes code reuse and adheres to the Open-Closed Principle.
- Avoids a proliferation of subclasses compared to inheritance-based approaches.

**Trade-offs**:
- Can lead to complex stacks of decorators that are harder to debug.
- May result in performance overhead due to multiple layers of wrapping.

---

### **5. Facade**

**Intent**:
- Provide a unified and simplified interface to a subsystem.

**Common Applications**:
- Simplifying interaction with complex APIs or third-party libraries.
- Hiding intricate details of a subsystem in large applications.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Shields clients from subsystem complexities, promoting low coupling.
- Can provide multiple facades for different subsystems.

**Trade-offs**:
- May become a bottleneck if too much functionality is centralized.
- Can inadvertently mask the full capabilities of the underlying subsystem.

---

### **6. Flyweight**

**Intent**:
- Reduce memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

**Common Applications**:
- Rendering large amounts of text with shared glyph objects.
- Managing objects in games with numerous similar elements (e.g., trees, particles).

**Key Characteristics**:
- Separates intrinsic state (shared) from extrinsic state (unique).
- Optimizes memory and performance for large object collections.

**Trade-offs**:
- Increases complexity by managing shared and unique states.
- May require significant refactoring to implement effectively.

---

### **7. Proxy**

**Intent**:
- Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access, add functionality, or improve performance.

**Common Applications**:
- Lazy initialization of heavy objects.
- Implementing security layers (e.g., access control proxies).
- Caching and logging.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Enhances flexibility by controlling object access and behavior.
- Can be implemented as virtual, remote, or protection proxies.

**Trade-offs**:
- Adds indirection, potentially increasing latency.
- Overuse can lead to unnecessary layers and reduced readability.
