title Flyweight Design Pattern

interface Flyweight {
	+ operation(extrinsicState: String)
}

class ConcreteFlyweight {
	- intrinsicState: String
	+ operation(extrinsicState: String)
}

class FlyweightFactory {
	- flyweights: Map<String, Flyweight>
	+ getFlyweight(key: String): Flyweight
}

class Client {
	+ extrinsicState: String
	+ requestFlyweight(key: String)
}

Flyweight <|.. ConcreteFlyweight
FlyweightFactory --> Flyweight : "creates or reuses"
Client --> FlyweightFactory : "requests Flyweight"
Client --> Flyweight : "uses with extrinsic state"
